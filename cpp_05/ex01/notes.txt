what is new in this exercise is the form file and 
we changed a bit bureacret excercise as well.

/*
	First thing new in the form hpp file is the call of
	
	bureacret class (class Bureaucrat)
	
	that because if included Bureaucrat in Form 
	and Form in Bureaucrat then it will cause infinity loop
	thats and because we know we only need the class so 
	calling the class is good enough
*/

/*
	const	std::string name;
	bool	isSigned;
	const	int	gradeToSign;
	const	int	gradeToExecute;
	
	name is the name a normal string
	
	issigned is a boolean to see if its signed or not
	
	gradeToSign is the grade that is least allowed to sign
	gradeToexecute is supposebly the grade that is least allowed to sign
*/

/* important things to know about form constructors
	default constructor does this
	 name("Default")
	isSigned(false)
	gradeToSign(150)
	gradeToExecute(150)
	
	I choose those to make sure it doesnt go outside of the range
	the paramater constructor get signed and then checks if it a legal grade
	and also isSigned(false)
*/

/* The last function that is different

it needs an arguement bureaucrat

beSigned so this function test first if the grade of the bureaucrat
is larger than the grade to signed then it is lower

then it assign true to issigned

isSigned = true 
*/

/* the only difference in the bureaucrat is the wrapper function

	so the Bureaucrat has a function that need a form object as an arguement
	and that function basically tries the be signed function
	if it fails it catches it writes couldnt sign it
*/
